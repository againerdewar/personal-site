    <p>
        I'm a mathematician and undergraduate mathematics educator, currently on the faculty at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota.
        My <a href="research.html">research</a> focuses on applications of the theory of combinatorial species to problems in graph enumeration; I am especially interested in using this as an avenue to introduce my students to the methods and experience of research-level mathematics.

        I am an alumnus of Woodstock High School (Woodstock, GA), <a href="//www.mercer.edu">Mercer University</a> (Macon, GA), and most recently <a href="//www.brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a> (Waltham, MA), where I completed a Ph.D. in mathematics under the advisement of <a href="//people.brandeis.edu/~gessel">Ira Gessel</a> in 2012.
