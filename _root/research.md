My ongoing research concentrates on the application of techniques from the theory of combinatorial species to problems in graph enumeration.
This work synthesizes the category-theoretic language of species theory, classical methods from enumerative combinatorics related to generating function algebra and PÃ³lya theory, and symbolic computer algebra using Sage.
The theoretical prerequisites are (perhaps surprisingly!) low, making it especially well-suited for undergraduate participation.

### Results
- In my dissertation, I developed a recursive enumeration of unlabeled $k$-trees.
  The [Sage](//www.sagemath.org) code I used to compute these numbers is [available](//aleph.sagemath.org/?z=eJy1VMtu1EAQvPsrWsplnH0kvqFVgkAo4oJQHiAliiDqHbd3R2vPmHkEW4h_p2e8YbNhA5sDPs2zqrqrxgdwRR5CCwhW6QWYCipjG6yhNd_JgiOryGWts9OT7jWcwnlcvkqrl3xBXFzkWXYA70zTBk_glwQL0mTRR7gqaOmV0REUgq5xTjWVcDOxxngerCbeEjmoVMezeQ8t2SZ4jHdcFIOwUPekQfayZvS-JWjClAk_msSGnufglibUJbRovUp0q-yNRLmk8u5BQVZSFRXciCaMQeezDPhTFWg4OYXjYRo_Sz5YDVyxKPK0SrWjzX7E6R3L9oxvhRwn2nxz4BFI4ovb09RNIfMxVLUxVgg9KfIjmedTF-ZO_Ohm3Vf5M98C2aIsyUnSJWp_1w6miOd5W2tKsUNkskGC0sN0N9saw4VGdIeH6kjB4S52tmEoSm0VoX4OLCqydBb1gkTBDR8VfIy6VsQRHJx1rdGkvULPh9FF4-E9OUc1cCCxfnmorv9_qkbFs7m6fkmwjncFa-MXP7Mam3mJIGdDhs4fNGzaLvPb2aT4snei1vSiYzv_yMejZDSBIbAs7-ZqYZbJrj28cE_NmIz5lY8B9S5jgot3vwXjFWfAZdhtSl5xE2cpfcURF4vBi5wlP25x4mKDWO3vxjixihHLsN8H6h9IEafbC-h62xsYwW3y5G_QL0520LsbGG-Xyrm-acjbPs6NpSbDp8qxE6ukaQTYr4cTXl2Po6Jz_v37hGjJhdrz0tsPZ5efZvCZHzwX4jzEYHEhgeAe60CD56vkMQdLh2bOJ_l58fuwmGdtgkTxagzFcT6VhqpKyeS4yH8BZ6cTfQ==&lang=sage) on the Sage "Aleph" server system.
- In a forthcoming paper co-authored with my Ph.D. adviser Ira Gessel, we enumerate unlabeled bipartite blocks.
- In another forthcoming paper with Ira Gessel, we enumerate unlabeled $k$-trees using a different structural approach than that applied in my dissertation.
- I am currently preparing a paper (available as a preprint below) in which I enumerate unlabeled polygonal and $k$-gonal 2-trees.

### Undergraduate research
I attended the [Valparaiso Experience in Research by Undergraduate Mathematicians](//www.valpo.edu/mcs/verum/) ("<span class="initialism">VERUM</span>"), an <span class="initialism">NSF</span>-sponsored <span class="initialism">REU</span> at Valparaiso University.
I also completed a research thesis for honors in the [mathematics department](//www.mercer.edu/math/) at [Mercer University](//www.mercer.edu).
Both were important and formative experiences in my mathematics education, and I believe such experiences should be available to any undergraduate who is interested in mathematics.

Now, as a research mathematician and educator, I hope to do my part to help provide those experiences to new generations of students.
My research methods lend themselves well to either a summer or senior-thesis setting for motivated undergraduates working alone or in a small group.
I believe the incorporation of modern computational techniques directly into the research of particularly valuable, since relatively few pure mathematicians use computation as an integral part of their work.

Last year, I directed four undergraduates in just such a project as part of Carleton College's mandatory Senior Comprehensive Project program.
After two terms of diligent work, they delivered an excellent hour-long lecture on the topic and produced a [paper](//apps.carleton.edu/curricular/math/assets/comps.agd.2012.pdf) combining expository material with original research on bipartite point-determining graphs and some interesting connections between point-determination and endpoint-freedom.
