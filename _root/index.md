I'm a mathematician and undergraduate mathematics educator, currently on the faculty at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota.
My [research](research.html) focuses on applications of the theory of combinatorial species to problems in graph enumeration; I am especially interested in using this as an avenue to introduce my students to the methods and experience of research-level mathematics.

I am an alumnus of Woodstock High School (Woodstock, GA), [Mercer University](//www.mercer.edu) (Macon, GA), and most recently [Brandeis University](//www.brandeis.edu) (Waltham, MA), where I completed a Ph.D. in mathematics under the advisement of [Ira Gessel](//people.brandeis.edu/~gessel) in 2012.
