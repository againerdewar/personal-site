### Strategies and techniques
I am interested in a variety of non-traditional teaching methodologies which encourage students to engage critically with mathematics and to reflect on their own learning processes.
So far, this has taken a few forms:

- Low-stakes writing projects, typically in the model of those in the excellent MAA book "Writing Projects for Mathematics Courses"
- Inverted classroom models, typically based on reading a textbook and working on exercises in groups (see my [posts](tags#inverted-ref) on the subject)
- Liberal-arts math courses, asking students to engage with sophisticated mathematics in humanistic models of inquiry (see my [posts](tags#liberal arts-ref) on the subject)

### Courses taught

#### Current Courses
In the spring term of 2014â€“2015, I am teaching a section of <span class="initialism">MATH111</span> (Calculus I) using a textbook-based inverted classroom.
In addition, I am offering a section of MATH-110 <q>Discovering in Mathematics</q> focusing on the mathematics of puzzles and games.

#### Past and upcoming courses
- Precalculus (Fall 2008)
- Calculus I (Spring 2009, Fall 2012, Winter 2012, Fall 2013, Winter 2013, Fall 2014, Spring 2014)
- Calculus II (Spring 2010, Spring 2013, Winter 2014, Spring 2014)
- Linear Algebra (Fall 2009, Spring 2013)
- "The Mathematics of Democracy" freshman seminar (Fall 2013)
- "Discovering in Mathematics: Puzzles and Games" (Spring 2015)
