Last term, I had the opportunity to run an interdisciplinary first-year seminar as part of Carleton's [A&amp;I][AnI] program.
The course I designed, &ldquo;The Mathematics of Democracy&rdquo;, focused on topics at the intersection of mathematics and political theory: social choice (the theory of voting mechanisms), representative apportionment, fair division, and such.
Running this course was an incredibly rewarding experience for me, and generally seemed to be a positive one for my students as well.

Here's the nuts and bolts of how I planned the course, what I did during the term, and what I learned about how to make these courses successful (and how not to!).

### Design goals
Carleton's A&amp;I program has an established list of &ldquo;required elements&rdquo; for all the seminars which broadly focus on introducing students to the themes of liberal education and the skills they'll need to succeed as scholars.
As I designed my course, I distilled my own ambitions down to three &ldquo;design goals&rdquo; which would guide my decisions about what my assignments required, what content the course would cover, and what my students would take away.

#### Interdisciplinary content
The courses I usually teach are highly disciplinary, and most college freshmen have never seen a math course that wasn't part of the algebra-calculus track.
I wanted my course to be an opportunity for me and my students to try on new hats&mdash;political scientist, philosopher, historian, *humanist*&mdash;within a mathematical setting.

#### Scholarship training
First-year college students often have little formal training in the craft of scholarship.
They may have written a few high-school term papers, but few have done what we'd call *research*.
I wanted my course to expose students to the idea of scholarly research in the context of disciplinary thinking.

#### Interesting math
Of course, I am a mathematician, and this was a mathematics course!
I wanted my course to have substantial mathematical content and to show students that math is more than algebra.

### Daily course structure
I built the course around a textbook&mdash;Taylor and Pacelli's [Mathematics and Politics][mnp].
Each course meeting was built around a reading selected from the text.
Early in the term, I made these readings short, hoping to encourage deep discussions and analysis, but the students ended up just being bored; speeding things up re-energized the class dramatically.

#### Prep sheets
After completing each reading assignment, students were required to write a set of structured notes known as a &ldquo;[prep sheet][prep]&rdquo; (based on a similar system used by [Joel Weisberg][jweisber]).
This has five components:

* **Outline**: make an outline of the reading
* **Summarize**: write a short summary of each section of the reading
* **Question**: write down any questions that came to mind during the reading, *whether you answered them yourself or not*
* **Synthesize**: write a summary of the reading as a whole
* **Engage**: write for about ten minutes about &ldquo;a broad or integrative question related to the reading&rdquo;

I collected these and graded them on a three-point scale (excellent/adequate/insufficient).
Their primary purpose, though, was to focus students' thinking as they read through the material and to prepare them for class discussions.

I was consistently impressed with the quality of students' writing and analysis in these documents, so in this sense the prep sheets were a great success.
However, my students were frequently frustrated by what they saw as a busy-work requirement.
In future attempts at these sorts of courses, I'll need to revisit this question&mdash;**how do I get students to see the value of this preparatory work?**

#### Exercises
I also sometimes assigned exercises to accompany the reading.
These were far more popular than I expected!
Exercises helped students think about the mathematical content of the reading and identify points of confusion.
They also gave us something to talk about in class.

#### Class discussion and activities
My initial plan was for every meeting of the course to be based entirely on whole-class discussion.
Alas, this proved impractical.
I am not an experienced discussion leader, and my students weren't used to finding an hour worth of things to say about a math book.

Once it became evident that this wasn't going to work out, I started incorporating &ldquo;preview activities&rdquo; as frequently as I could design them.
These took a variety of forms, but were generally focused on exposing the *problems* that the next reading would investigate and solve.
The activities never fully replaced discussion, but they generally cut it down to thirty or forty minutes per meeting, which was a much more approachable length of time.

For example, before starting to read about procedures for apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, I handed out a table listing the populations of the States and asked students to come up with methods in pairs.
This took about twenty minutes; at the end, I tabulated the results, put them on the board, and asked the students to compare the outcome.
Once they started debating the relative merits of their different methods, they quickly realized that they were facing a hard problem, and this made the subsequent readings much more interesting and relevant.

#### Post-class follow-up
I did not use any post-class follow-up assignments in this course; I think this was a mistake.

### Major assignments
In addition to the daily work, the course had four major assignments: three essays and a final project.

#### Essay 1: Proof
The [first assignment][essay1] asked students to devise their own social choice procedure and then prove that it does or does not have each of five properties defined in the text.
This is a very standard type of mathematics assignment, but one students are unlikely to have seen in high school.
Thus, this assignment serves several purposes:

* It exposes students to the rhetorical standards of mathematics, and in particular to the standards of mathematics *that is not problem sets*.
* It asks students to engage critically with ideas they otherwise could just passively absorb.
* It introduces students to a world of scholarship where they may have to train themselves.

I gave students a bit of guidance about how to write proofs (both explicitly when handing out the assignment and implicitly when discussing the proofs in the text), but mostly I let the drafting process steer them.
Each student was required to prepare a draft of their procedure description and at least two proofs, then meet with the course's Writing Assistant (a senior undergraduate assigned to the course) to discuss these before submitting them to me.
I returned the drafts with feedback, then collected the final versions (with all five proofs) a week later.

This structure worked very well.
Devising mathematical structures and proving that they have properties is my job, so asking my students to do it was comfortable and natural.

#### Essay 2: History
The [second assignment][essay2] asked students to investigate the history of apportionment in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The method used to apportion seats has changed five times, each of which is discussed in brief in the course text.
Each student was asked to choose one of these five instances, investigate it in detail, and write up their findings with analysis.
The assignment required four cited sources, at least two of which needed to be primary historical documents.

Of course, I'm not a historian!
Asking my students to do academic history took the class way outside of my comfort zone.

Fortunately, I had fantastic help.
[Kristin Partlo][kpartlo], one of Carleton's library subject liasons, worked with me to design the assignment and put together a spectacular &ldquo;[Gould Guide][libguide]&rdquo; and in-class presentation which introduced students to the wealth of historical source material available.
With very limited guidance from me, my students succeeded in digging up Congressional debate records, texts of proposed bills, and other materials.

The reception of this assignment was quite mixed.
Many students were frustrated by the lack of structure, but the class as a whole rose to the challenge, and they evidently learned quite a lot about disciplinarity and scholarly research.
In future iterations of this course, I'll be sure to make my goals more explicit.

#### Essay 3: Op-Ed
The [third assignment][essay3] asked students to confront the central theme of the course&mdash;that, mathematically, any effort at democracy must be compromised.
They were required to select a &ldquo;real-world democratic system&rdquo; (defined broadly), then, in a long-form journalistic essay, explain the system, discuss its mathematical properties and the relevant results from the course, and argue that the system is or is not ideal in light of the compromises that must be made.

This was an unqualified success.
The papers evinced rich understanding of the mathematical theory of the course, and the students generally found the right timbre and level of technicality.
Moreover, it was clear that **the students had a lot of fun**; they wrote about topics ranging from TV talent shows to baseball's MVP process to Zimbabwean Presidential politics.

#### Final project
Finally, at the end of the term I had students pair off and study independently on special topics of their choosing (with a list of suggestions from me).
This process culminated in half-hour presentations to the class and expository papers submitted to me.

Before the presentations started, I spent some time in class talking about presentation strategies, slide design, and other related topics.
Additionally, I provided copies of the [rubric] I would use to score their presentations.
Additionally, each student was required to fill out a [self-evaluation][selfeval] for their own presentation and an [audience evaluation][audeval] for each other group.
This encouraged students to reflect on their own preparation and to pay attention to their peer's presentations.

The resulting presentations were generally quite good, with a few rough edges.
In future courses, I plan to require students to do a practice run of their talk for a friend (who will fill out an evaluation form I design); this should help prevent under-preparedness, which was the most common problem I saw.

### Lessons
So what did I learn about how to run a liberal-arts mathematics seminar?

#### Move quickly
Don't be afraid to maintain a brisk pace.
Your students signed up for your course, after all&mdash;clearly, they want to learn!
Of course, you may have to adjust your pace as you go, but, especially with freshmen, it's important not to drag out any one topic for too long.

#### Be responsive (but not too responsive)
This advice applies to pacing, of course, but there are many other areas of course design where it pays to pay attention to what your students want.
For example, part-way through the term, I discovered (to my surprise) that my students actually wanted *more* exercises!
Mid-term feedback forms are a great way to get this kind of information and to take the pulse of the class.

#### Explore disciplines
The most exciting parts of this course were the moments when we discovered ways that mathematics and other disciplines could inform each other.
With this subject, history, philosophy, political science, and sociology were all in play.
I'm far from an expert in any of these, but my students and I were able to work together to discover some fascinating connections.

#### Take advantage of human resources
I could never have assigned a history paper on my own and had any degree of success.
It was only possible through collaborations.
Conversations with Catherine Walden (an academic art historian at Carleton) helped me understand what historians do and what they expect their students to do.
[Kristin][kpartlo] in the library put together the resources my students needed to understand the historical source material and instructed them in their use.

#### Have fun
This process was an adventure!
I learned a lot about teaching, about disciplines outside mathematics, and about the mathematics of social choice.
This was an opportunity: to get outside my disciplinary comfort zone, to try new pedagogies and assignment structures, and to return to my academic roots in the liberal arts.
I can't wait to do it again.
