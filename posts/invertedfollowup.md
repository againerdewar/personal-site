In a [recent post][invert], I wrote at length about my experiences inverting a section of Calculus I at Carleton College.
Now that the term is over and I've had some time to process my experiences and the students' end-of-term evaluations, I want to follow up with some of my thoughts about what went well, what can be improved, and whether I'd do it again.

### Would I do it again?
***Absolutely.***

I'm incredibly pleased with the results of this model.
My students learned a ton of math, and they (mostly) had a great time doing it.
Once I settled into the rhythm of running the class, it was a delight for me as well.

### What went well
The core design principle of this course was to make students active, critical consumers of mathematical knowledge.

This was a huge success.

Roughly half of the students explicitly mentioned this on their evaluations; when asked what he or she found most helpful in the course, one student wrote this:
<blockquote>
I found reading assignments by myself very very effective than [sic] I have imagined in the beginning of the term.
I never really knew I could learn so much by trying to comprehend the materials by struggling with them.
</blockquote>
Similarly, when asked what was the most important thing they learned in the class, a second student wrote:
<blockquote>
The most important lesson that I learned in this course is the importance of fighting with the material.
This means you can always learn new materials by yourself if you try really hard.
I've talked with my professor about this and he did this on purpose.
At least for me, this method was very effective.
I am no longer afraid of Calculus and definitely have a totally different stance in terms of how I view Calculus from a year ago.
</blockquote>

These students learned a lot of calculus—their test scores make that very clear—but they also learned something much more valuable: *that they are capable of learning mathematics on their own*.
I've always struggled with student confidence in the past, so this is a particularly exciting result.

The in-class group work (and absence of traditional formal lectures) emphasized the value of peer support.
As one student wrote,
<blockquote>
I learned the importance and helpfulness of working with peers.
I learned *so* much from peer explanations in this class which was much more beneficial than having a professor lecturing at me.
</blockquote>
Many students also discovered the power of learning by teaching:
<blockquote>
Working on pre-class exercises was very helpful to me.
It helped solidify the material when I explained it to a classmate or when a classmate was able to explain a topic to me.
</blockquote>

Additionally, students' mathematical maturity improved substantially over the course of the term.
In my [previous post][invert] on this topic, I mentioned how student questions became quite sophisticated by the end of the term.
The end-of-course evaluations also revealed a surprisingly mature perspective on the practice of learning mathematics.
Asked about the most important thing they learned in the course, one student noted that
<blockquote>
There is no one right method to get an answer.
</blockquote>
and another concluded
<blockquote>
Doing practice problems and understanding theorems is the best way for me to study calculus.
</blockquote>
("Understanding theorems!" From the mouths of freshmen!)

### What can be improved
Of course, there were some hiccoughs.

I was already well aware that the first couple of weeks of the course were (relatively) rough, but the evaluations confirmed this.
In response to the question "What do you wish you had known on the first day of class?", many students mentioned nuts-and-bolts issues like time management and working with peers.

Additionally, although most students felt quite confident in their abilities by the end of the term, I could have done (and will do!) considerably more to start this process early.
The process of wrestling with unfamiliar material, fighting to solve problems with it, and gradually learning through hard-won insights is an incredibly powerful experience, but it can also be demoralizing until students learn to accept struggle and failure as part of the process.
Specifically, many entry-level mathematics students don't recognize that having to work hard to learn something is not itself failure; they're accustomed to classroom models where "success" means not having to work.

Late in the term, I added a new ingredient to the mix of classroom activities—the "mini-lecture".
These brief (typically less than five minutes), high-level explanations of the core ideas of each topic were very popular with the students, and many students expressed a wish to have more of those from the beginning of the course.
I'm still thinking about how to incorporate this suggestion without drifting back into a "learn from the lecture" model, which I fear would totally shut down the self-learning aspect that made this course so successful.

Of course, the greatest vulnerability in a textbook-driven course model is the textbook itself.
When asked what should change about the course the next time it is taught, one student commented:
<blockquote>
I think that sometimes the book's explanation is more confusing and convoluted than necessary.
I would have wished that some sections had a handout that explained them better and maybe each day the prof went through one problem on the board.
</blockquote>
Towards the end of the term, I started posting a "reading guide" with each reading assignment—a few paragraphs of prose tellings students which parts of the text I think are important, what key ideas they should focus on, and other similar information.
(Basically, I write down the sorts of things I would say to a student if I were reading through the text with them.)
In the future, I'll do this from the beginning; I may also take this student's suggestion to replace some especially bad textbook readings with handouts.

### Student resistance
During the term, there was very little student resistance; as long as I was careful to say explicitly what my goals were and how my plans fit into those, my students were willing to go along with just about any crazy thing I cooked up.
Still, at the end of the term, not everyone was satisfied.
For example, one student wrote:
<blockquote>
I think the instructor needs to explain problems more thoroughly.
Self-taught classes did not help me.
</blockquote>

I asked each student to indicate how strongly they agreed with the statement "I found this course structure more effective than a traditional lecture/homework model" on a five-point scale.
Here's the results:

<table class="table text-center">

Effectively, the class is split.
For the first time out of the gate, and given that the results were measurably and palpably better than in my previous lecture-based courses, this is a result I can live with, but I think this can be better.

A common theme among students who responded negatively was a sense that the group work was ineffective for them.
Some simply didn't like working with their classmates, but others reported that their groups were dysfunctional in various ways.
In particular:
<blockquote>
Sometimes the small group discussions drift off topic a bit.
It would be nice if that time is a little bit more effectively used.
</blockquote>
I'm still working on ways to improve this dynamic.
Walking around the room and checking in with groups seemed to be fairly effective, but I'm sure I can do more.

A few students simply didn't like being asked to teach themselves.
<blockquote>
I think the instructor needs to explain problems more thoroughly.
Self-taught classes did not help me.
</blockquote>
This seems to have been isolated to a couple of students, but it's obviously important to keep in mind when planning a non-traditional class.
I'm hopeful that I can improve on this by emphasizing the diversity of resources available to students—including my office hours, which were somewhat sparsely attended.

### Looking ahead
Next term, I'll be running another section of Calculus I as well as a fairly large (~36 students) section of Calculus II.
I'm going to use the self-taught model for both courses, but I'll be keeping a careful eye on student progress—especially in Calculus II, where I fear the textbook may be more of an obstacle.
Still, I'm optimistic.
Based on the success of this first course, I believe this model has a lot to offer students, and I'm confident that I can improve it substantially the next time around.
