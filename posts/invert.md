This term, I inverted a section of Calculus I here at Carleton.
The results have been extraordinary; my students are asking great questions and reporting significantly increased interest and confidence, enrollment into Calculus II next term is robust, and *not a single student failed either midterm exam!*

Here's the nuts and bolts of how I did it.

### Motivation
I used to be pretty serious about lecture.
I was thoughtful and thorough when I wrote my notes before class; I took care to produce board work that would translate well into student notes; I planned sequences of examples that would guide my students to understanding.
Still, I knew that it wasn't really right.

In the wake of some sessions at the Project NExT workshops at MathFest–2013, I went back to the drawing board.
After some reflection, I identified four major themes that led to my dissatisfaction with lecture:

1. Students have different needs when it comes to pacing.
One student may want to run through a given topic several times, digging deeply into several examples, while another would prefer to take it at a run and move on to something else.
A lecture cannot possibly respond to all these needs at the same time.

1. Despite the lecturer's best efforts, students may never be completely comfortable asking questions in class.
They may feel that their question is <q>stupid</q> or that their peers will think less of them for asking it; they may not want to interrupt the flow of the lecture; they may not even know they *have* a question until the opportunity has passed.
This is especially difficult for slower students, whose mathematical confidence and interest suffers needlessly as a result.

1. Much of the real learning happens when students work on their homework after class.
Many of my best teaching interactions have happened in office hours while talking through homework problems; students who have already wrestled with the concepts and problems themselves are much better equipped to ask good questions and to use the answers.

1. Lectures are kind of boring for everyone involved.
(This probably isn't true for everyone, but it definitely was for me, and seemed to be for many of my students.)

So what to do?
I decided to try a textbook-based inverted classroom.

### Implementation

In broad strokes, the idea behind my classroom model is simple: students read the text, do homework, get help from me and their peers, and then do more homework.
This takes place on a rolling schedule.
For each slice of material, students go through the following process, closely modeled on [David Pengelley](http://www.math.nmsu.edu/~davidp/)'s system at <span class="initalism">NMSU</span>:

1. Prior to the class meeting, read the assigned section of the textbook.
   I post a <q>reading guide</q> along with the assignment, which includes various notes and annotations to accompany the text, guiding students to the most important material and helping them navigate the writing.

1. During the reading, write a <q>reflective response</q> which answers several questions:
  * What were the main mathematical topics and ideas of this section?
  * What did you find particularly confusing or difficult to undersatnd in this section?
  * What did you find particularly surprising, exciting, or unexpected in this section?
  * What are some questions that came to mind as you were reading this material? (These may be questions you want me to answer or questions you answered yourself!)
  * How much time did you spend reading this material? If you have done the exercises, how much time did you spend on them?
  * Did you find the material unusually easy or difficult to read and understand?
  * How do you feel about the amount of work you spent on this section and on the course so far?
  * Is there anything else you would like me to know before class starts?

   These are submitted privately to me through Carleton's <span class="initialism">CMS</span> and are due six hours before the start of class.
   I read them over and use them to guide my preparation.

1. After the reading, work through a series of pre-class exercises.
   These typically consist of a handful of concept-check questions and one or two more challenging problems.

1. In class, form a small group and work through the pre-class exercises.
   The exercises are turned in to me at the end of the class meeting; I grade them for completion only.
   I also take additional, optional exercises to class for the use of groups that have time left after finishing this task; these are never collected or graded.

   While students are working on the exercises, I wander around the room, answering questions and listening to their conversations.

   Based on the information in the online responses, I may give a brief <q>mini-lecture</q> at the start of class which responds to specific questions or concerns.
   These never last more than a few minutes.


1. After class, work through a series of post-class exercises.
   These typically consist of a few more concept-check questions and several more challenging problems.
   I urge students to work on these alone first, as a way to check their understanding before moving on to the next topic.
   These are collected at the next class meeting and are graded for mathematical correctness and clarity.

***That's it.***
I don't give lectures in class for more than a few minutes a day; I don't post video lectures or screen casts; I don't even write lecture notes to post on a website.
I just tell my students to go read the book and do homework.

### Response and results
Perhaps the most telling sign of the success of this system is one that's simple to measure: ***my students love it.***
They've discovered how satisfying it is to earn their mathematical success:
<blockquote>
Oddly enough, I actually had fun doing this homework.
I started out frustrated because I didn't instantly understand the material, but I found that it was gratifying to try a problem I wasn't entirely sure I could do and get it right in the end.
</blockquote>

Students who might otherwise have been left behind are able to learn at their own pace, and these students in particular are prospering:
<blockquote>
I really like the class structure and how you emphasize the importance of asking questions.
I am usually a shy student but because the open environment you've created in the classroom, I feel that I can ask a question for clarification if I ever need to (thanks, and hopefully I will ask a question!).
</blockquote>

Working in small, self-selected groups has given students the space to find and digest answers to any lingering questions from the homework:
<blockquote>
It is exciting to see calculus become more and more applicable!
[…] I feel good about the work I have [been] doing in this class.
I feel like I am cementing the ideas because we actually have time in class to discuss pre-class exercises and get peer-led corrections.
</blockquote>

Moreover, my students are learning calculus at a really remarkable level.
Their performance on tests and graded homeworks is dramatically better than I've seen in previous terms at Carleton, and I've observed a substantial (but harder-to-quantify) increase in inquiries about the major and general mathematical interest.
